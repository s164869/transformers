# AGENTS.md Guide for Hugging Face Transformers

You are a contributor-focused assistant for this repo. Prioritize small, reviewable changes and help users succeed with CI.

**New Contributors: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for complete setup and workflow details.**

**Commands (Run Early)**
- Style/format: `make style`
- Repo checks: `make check-repo`
- Auto-fix repo consistency: `make fix-repo`
- Core tests: `make test`
- Examples tests: `make test-examples`

**Environment Setup**
If the environment is not yet set up:
1. Requires Python 3.10+ but 3.10 recommended as the minimal supported Python
2. Install dev dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
3. Verify install with `make check-repo`

**Quick Start**
- Prefer the smallest change that fixes the issue.
- Use `rg` to locate files; avoid broad file reads.
- If you touched copied code, modular files, docs TOCs, or docstrings, run `make fix-repo`.
- Otherwise, run `make style` before you finish.

**Example Flows**
- Small code change: edit -> `make style` -> targeted `pytest ...`
- Modular/copies change: edit source/modular -> `make fix-repo` -> targeted `pytest ...`
- Docs change: edit -> update `_toctree.yml` if new file -> (optional) doc build

**Repo Map**
- `src/transformers`: core library code.
- `src/transformers/models`: per-model implementations.
- `tests`: core tests and model tests.
- `examples`: example scripts and example tests.
- `docs/source/en`: documentation sources (MDX-like Markdown).

**Boundaries**
- Always: keep diffs minimal, follow existing patterns, prefer targeted tests.
- Ask first: adding dependencies, modifying CI, changing public APIs, large refactors.
- Never: edit generated modeling files when a `modular_<name>.py` exists.
- Dependencies: see [CONTRIBUTING.md#do-you-want-to-add-documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md) for adding new dependencies (ask maintainers first).

**Tech Stack**
- Python package with PyTorch focus; tests run with `pytest`, formatting via `ruff`.
- Docs built with `doc-builder` (see `docs/README.md`).

**Copies and Modular Models**
- If a file has `# Copied from ...`, change the source and run `make fix-repo` to propagate.
- If a model has `modular_<name>.py`, do not edit generated `modeling_*.py` files directly. Edit modular and run `make fix-repo` (or `python utils/modular_model_converter.py <name>`).

**Testing (smallest relevant set)**
- Targeted model tests: `pytest tests/models/<name>/test_modeling_<name>.py`
- Tokenizers/processors: `pytest tests/models/<name>/test_tokenization_<name>.py` or `test_processing_<name>.py`
- Examples: `make test-examples`
- Full suite: `make test`
- Slow tests: `RUN_SLOW=1 pytest ...`

**CI Test Selection**
- CI runs only tests impacted by the diff.
- Reproduce locally: `python utils/tests_fetcher.py`
- Run list: `python -m pytest -n 8 --dist=loadfile -rA -s $(cat test_list.txt)`

**Docs Notes**
- Docs use MDX-like syntax; keep formatting minimal and consistent.
- Adding a doc requires updating `docs/source/en/_toctree.yml`.
- Local docs build uses `doc-builder` and dev extras in `docs/README.md`.

**Makefile Truth**
- `make style` runs ruff format/check plus repo formatters.
- `make check-repo` runs CI-style consistency checks.
- `make fix-repo` auto-fixes copies, modular conversions, doc TOCs, doctest lists, and docstrings.

**Git Workflow**
- Keep PRs small; avoid unrelated refactors and sweeping reformatting.
- When uncertain, prefer targeted changes and ask before widening scope.
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md#create-a-pull-request](CONTRIBUTING.md#create-a-pull-request) for full PR workflow.

**Troubleshooting**
- `make style` failures: read output carefully—most are auto-fixed, some need manual fixes. Common: import ordering, docstring formatting.
- `make check-repo` failures: check specific error message. If it mentions copies/modular/TOC/docstrings, run `make fix-repo`.
- Test failures: check test output for assertion errors. Verify changes didn't break existing behavior.
- Import errors after install: ensure you ran `pip install -e ".[dev]"` with `-e` flag for editable mode.
- Slow tests timing out: use `RUN_SLOW=1` environment variable only when needed.

**Common Errors**
- "import failed, unprotected imports": you added an import without proper guards. Check `__init__.py` patterns.
- "modular conversion failed": modular file has syntax errors. Run `python utils/modular_model_converter.py <name>` to debug.
- "copies check failed": edited a `# Copied from ...` file directly. Edit the source file instead and run `make fix-repo`.
- "doc TOC check failed": added a doc without updating `docs/source/en/_toctree.yml`. Add your file there.

**Output Example**
- Good: "Edited `src/transformers/models/bert/modeling_bert.py`, ran `make style`, ran `pytest tests/models/bert/test_modeling_bert.py`."
